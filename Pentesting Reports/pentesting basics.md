# Penetration Testing Basics

## Reconnaissance

### Active Reconnaissance with Nmap

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool used to discover hosts and services on a computer network. It is commonly used during penetration testing for port scanning, service detection, and operating system identification.

#### Common Nmap Options:
- `-sS`: Performs a stealthy SYN scan.
- `-sV`: Detects service versions.
- `-O`: Detects the operating system.
- `-A`: Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
- `-T2`: Sets a "polite" timing template to reduce network congestion or detection.
- `-p-`: Scans all 65,535 TCP ports.
- `target_ip`: Replace this with the IP address of your target.

#### Full Nmap Command:
```bash
nmap -sS -sV -O -A -T2 -p- target_ip
```

### Gobuster Command
DirBuster is a powerful tool for brute-forcing directories and file names on a web server to enumerate hidden resources
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt
```
In Kali there is a GUI version called DirBuster
